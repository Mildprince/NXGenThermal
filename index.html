                Our system deploys the indudstry’s first ever, 3D thin film on the chip two-phase
                evaporative cooling solution. The combination of elements found in traditional cooling
                systems, enhanced by the proprietary geometry of our unique microchannel
                construction and our novel two phase evaporative process, promises the highest heat
                transfer efficiency, making it ideal for high performance cooling applications.

                    Our system leverages and perfectly balances the power of evaporative cooling, and it’s
                    exceptionally high heat transfer coefficient, with the unique physics of enhanced cooling
                    though the use of proprietary microchannels. With our copper device placed directly on the
                    chip, with heat spreader removed, all resistance from thermal pastes and other materials are
                    eliminated. A carefully calibrated flow system optimizes the performance, avoiding burnout
                    and boiling. It can be deployed as a new system in Data centers, as a retrofit for liquid cooling
                    systems, or even applied to immersion cooling.

                    The company has developed and tested a working prototype that has
                    delivered perfomance results similar to those of high performance liquid
                    cooling. With the technology and science now confirmed, it is moving
                    forward to its next gen prototype which will utilize advanced materials such
                    as graphene, silicon, and sophisticated methods such as electrostatic
                    etching, and be built in a clean room environment. The company’s modeling suggest that this next-gen evaporative cooling solution using
                    advanced materials can remove 7X to 10X more heat than the traditional
                    copper based prototype, making it ideal for AI GPUs, #D ICs, and high
                    density data centers.
